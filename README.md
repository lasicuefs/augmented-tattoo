# Augmented Tattoo

Augmented Reality (AR) system for visualization of virtual tattoos on the skin, accompanying the surface of the human body. From a captured image, the system detects markers on the skin, and outputs an image without the markers with an AR tattoo inscribed to the skin. Features include skin segmentation and markers removal.
